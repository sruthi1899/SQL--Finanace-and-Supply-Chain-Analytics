1) Generate a yearly report for Croma India where there are two columns

	1. Fiscal Year
	2. Total Gross Sales amount In that year from Croma


	select
            get_fiscal_year(date) as fiscal_year,
            sum(round(sold_quantity*g.gross_price,2)) as yearly_sales
	from fact_sales_monthly s
	join fact_gross_price g
	on 
	    g.fiscal_year=get_fiscal_year(s.date) and
	    g.product_code=s.product_code
	where
	    customer_code=90002002
	group by get_fiscal_year(date)
	order by fiscal_year;
2.) Create a report to get the net_invoice_sales amount using Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
CREATE  VIEW `sales_preinv_discount` AS
	SELECT 
    	    s.date, 
            s.fiscal_year,
            s.customer_code,
            c.market,
            s.product_code, 
            p.product, 
            p.variant, 
            s.sold_quantity, 
            g.gross_price as gross_price_per_item,
            ROUND(s.sold_quantity*g.gross_price,2) as gross_price_total,
            pre.pre_invoice_discount_pct
	FROM fact_sales_monthly s
	JOIN dim_customer c 
		ON s.customer_code = c.customer_code
	JOIN dim_product p
        	ON s.product_code=p.product_code
	JOIN fact_gross_price g
    		ON g.fiscal_year=s.fiscal_year
    		AND g.product_code=s.product_code
	JOIN fact_pre_invoice_deductions as pre
        	ON pre.customer_code = s.customer_code AND
    		pre.fiscal_year=s.fiscal_year
3.) Create a view for post-invoice deductions: sales_postinv_discount.
CREATE VIEW `sales_postinv_discount` AS
	SELECT 
    	    s.date, s.fiscal_year,
            s.customer_code, s.market,
            s.product_code, s.product, s.variant,
            s.sold_quantity, s.gross_price_total,
            s.pre_invoice_discount_pct,
            (s.gross_price_total-s.pre_invoice_discount_pct*s.gross_price_total) as net_invoice_sales,
            (po.discounts_pct+po.other_deductions_pct) as post_invoice_discount_pct
	FROM sales_preinv_discount s
	JOIN fact_post_invoice_deductions po
		ON po.customer_code = s.customer_code AND
   		po.product_code = s.product_code AND
   		po.date = s.date;
4.) Create a report as view for net sales
	CREATE VIEW `net_sales` AS
	SELECT 
            *, 
    	    net_invoice_sales*(1-post_invoice_discount_pct) as net_sales
	FROM gdb0041.sales_postinv_discount;
5.) create a  Stored procedure  to get top n markets by net sales for a given year
	CREATE PROCEDURE `get_top_n_markets_by_net_sales`(
        	in_fiscal_year INT,
    		in_top_n INT
	)
	BEGIN
        	SELECT 
                     market, 
                     round(sum(net_sales)/1000000,2) as net_sales_mln
        	FROM net_sales
        	where fiscal_year=in_fiscal_year
        	group by market
        	order by net_sales_mln desc
        	limit in_top_n;
	END
6.) Generate monthly gross sales report for any customer using stored procedure
	CREATE PROCEDURE `get_monthly_gross_sales_for_customer`(
        	in_customer_codes TEXT
	)
	BEGIN
        	SELECT 
                    s.date, 
                    SUM(ROUND(s.sold_quantity*g.gross_price,2)) as monthly_sales
        	FROM fact_sales_monthly s
        	JOIN fact_gross_price g
               	    ON g.fiscal_year=get_fiscal_year(s.date)
                    AND g.product_code=s.product_code
        	WHERE 
                    FIND_IN_SET(s.customer_code, in_customer_codes) > 0
        	GROUP BY s.date
        	ORDER BY s.date DESC;
	END
7.) create stored procedure that takes market, fiscal_year and top n as an input and returns top n customers by net sales in that given fiscal year and market
	CREATE PROCEDURE `get_top_n_customers_by_net_sales`(
        	in_market VARCHAR(45),
        	in_fiscal_year INT,
    		in_top_n INT
	)
	BEGIN
        	select 
                     customer, 
                     round(sum(net_sales)/1000000,2) as net_sales_mln
        	from net_sales s
        	join dim_customer c
                on s.customer_code=c.customer_code
        	where 
		    s.fiscal_year=in_fiscal_year 
		    and s.market=in_market
        	group by customer
        	order by net_sales_mln desc
        	limit in_top_n;
	END
8.) Create stored procedure to get_top_n_products_per_division_by_qty_sold
CREATE PROCEDURE `get_top_n_products_per_division_by_qty_sold`(
        	in_fiscal_year INT,
    		in_top_n INT
	)
	BEGIN
	     with cte1 as (
		   select
                       p.division,
                       p.product,
                       sum(sold_quantity) as total_qty
                   from fact_sales_monthly s
                   join dim_product p
                       on p.product_code=s.product_code
                   where fiscal_year=in_fiscal_year
                   group by p.product),            
             cte2 as (
		   select 
                        *,
                        dense_rank() over (partition by division order by total_qty desc) as drnk
                   from cte1)
	     select * from cte2 where drnk <= in_top_n;
	END
9.) Write a stored proc that can retrieve market badge. i.e. if total sold quantity > 5 million that market is considered "Gold" else "Silver"
	CREATE PROCEDURE `get_market_badge`(
        	IN in_market VARCHAR(45),
        	IN in_fiscal_year YEAR,
        	OUT out_level VARCHAR(45)
	)
	BEGIN
             DECLARE qty INT DEFAULT 0;
    
    	     # Default market is India
    	     IF in_market = "" THEN
                  SET in_market="India";
             END IF;
    
    	     # Retrieve total sold quantity for a given market in a given year
             SELECT 
                  SUM(s.sold_quantity) INTO qty
             FROM fact_sales_monthly s
             JOIN dim_customer c
             ON s.customer_code=c.customer_code
             WHERE 
                  get_fiscal_year(s.date)=in_fiscal_year AND
                  c.market=in_market;
        
             # Determine Gold vs Silver status
             IF qty > 5000000 THEN
                  SET out_level = 'Gold';
             ELSE
                  SET out_level = 'Silver';
             END IF;
	END
